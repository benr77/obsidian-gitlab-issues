Gitlab Issues for Obsidian
====

A plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to import issues from Gitlab.

Each issue returned from Gitlab is created as an Obsidian note in the specified output directory.

You can create your own template to customise the format of the issue note.

Notes are intended to be *READ ONLY*, as they will be removed from your Obsidian vault if they no longer are 
returned by Gitlab.

Issues are queried for every hour.

## Configuration

You must have a Gitlab account.

1) Generate a Gitlab [Personal Access Token](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens) for the plugin that 
   has `API` scope included.
2) Install the plugin through the Obsidian Community Plugins section, and then enable it.
3) Enter the Personal Access Token you created at Gitlab into the Token field in the plugin settings.

## Example - Listing upcoming deadlines

With the default filter value of `due_date=month`, the Gitlab API will return all issues that have a Due Date in the 
next month.

The plugin will create an Obsidian note file for each issue.

You can then use the excellent [DataView Plugin](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) to create lists 
of upcoming issues to embed anywhere you like in your vault. For example:

```yaml
dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID file.link AS "Task", dueDate AS "Due Date" from "@Data/Gitlab Issues"
SORT dueDate
```

If you then close an issue on Gitlab, or change its due date to be further in the future, the issue will be removed 
from your vault, and the DataView list will no longer show the issue.

## Going Further

### Customise the API query
You can use any valid query filter permitted by Gitlab in the "Issues List" endpoint. See the [Gitlab API 
Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/issues.html#list-issues) for all possible options.

### Use a custom template
You can customise the template used to create the new notes. Create a note for the template, and specify the path 
to this note in the plugin settings.

The template must be a valid Handlebars template. See the [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/) documentation 
for more information on the syntax.

Currently, the available fields include:

`id` `title` `description` `due_date` `web_url`
